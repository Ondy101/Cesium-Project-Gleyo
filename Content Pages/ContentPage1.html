            "Black lives matter!" This is the cry of those people who experienced harassments and loved ones being killed
            because of the color of their skin. This incident brought global concern among intermational leaders and the United
            Nations who believe " that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and have the potential to
            contribute constructively to the development and well - beings  of society. " It is believed that no race  is superior
            over the other. Any belief of " racial superiority is condemnable socially unjust and dangerous." And what does racism mean?
            <br><br>
            According to the Oxford Dictionary, racism is the inability or refusal to recognize the rights, needs, dignity or value of people
            of particular races or geographical or ethnic origin. It can come in the form of harassment, abuse or humiliation, violence or
            intimidating behavior. However, racism also exists in systems and institutions that operate in ways that lead to inequality and
            injustice (Australian Human Rights Commission, n.d.).
            <br><br>
            When there is racial discrimmination, this brings tremendous effect on the individual and the society in general. Studies revealed
            that racial discrimination produced unfavorable effect such as psycholigical distress, reduced psychological well - being reduced self - esteem,
            impaired mental health which might lead to psychiatric disorders which are harmful to society. Lack of self - esteem leads to lack of self - confidence
            on who they are and what they can do; they find hard to cope with challenging tasks. Instead of encouraging and building active and productive individuals,
            racial discrimination curtail their worth and dignity.
            <br><br>
            How can the damage of racism or racial discrimination be addressed? To fight racism is to create a culture of trust, mutual respect, recognize, the rights and
            dignity of the other races and stop humiliating others and this  should  begin in us, the youth of today.
