			"Uy Nigro!, Uy si Chinchong oh!" Racism is a negative habit that society simply cannot seem to break.
			Racism continues to infiltrate our communities, companies, and schools despite decades of progress,
			creating needless barriers on everyone. It is a systematic issue that impacts laws, regulations, and
			daily life, slowing progress and increasing divisions. It is not just a personal problem. This article
			explores the ways racism impacts communities and professions, demonstrating why addressing racism directly
			is not just long overdue but also essential for a suitable and successful society. 
            <br><br>
            Racism is a widespread issue that affects many branches of society. In education, racial discrimination is
			linked to “lower school engagement and greater school disconnection” (Bottiani, et al. 2020). Similarly,
			racism leads to not only mental but also physical health issues, ultimately resulting in decreased workplace
			productivity (Gonzales, 2022). Individuals who experience this type of discrimination often seek refuge by
			keeping their silence against favored oppressors, and stories like these almost always go nowhere; it is an
			incessant problem that isn’t brought up loud enough by everyone.
            <br><br>
            Racism is an issue that continues to plague settings ranging from schools to companies and significantly
			disrupts their overall performance. However, it should not always end this way. It is time that we, as a
			society, strive together to put an end to racial discrimination. Ample intervention from teachers in educational
			settings, admins from both public and private companies, and even those in politics could go a long way for not
			only ourselves but also the world.
