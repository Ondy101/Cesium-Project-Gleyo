			Prohibiting both individual and institutional racism 
            have been introduced and implemented in order to prevent and fight against
            discrimination, still, there is ongoing argument whether these efforts are 
            enough to aid in building a just society. Examining criticisms through histories
            of anti racism â€“ and its possible politics in the struggle for racial equity. 
            <br><br>
            Member states are required to undertake positive action towards the elimination 
            of discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnicity as expressed in Paragraph 1, 
            Article 2 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination
            (ICERD) (United Nations, 1965). It is explicitly stated in the Preamble of the United Nations Charter 
            that the Organization's purpose is not only to strieve for peace but also to foster and promote 
            among other things, human rights and fundamental freedom for all without discrimination on the basis 
            of race, sex, language or religion (United Nations, 1945).  Marginalization is one of the core reasons
            as to why structural and systemic racism has been difficult to uproot, in that racism demonstrates itself even 
            in the very structures and moulds of societal chauvinism. The former tends to encompass and define a social order
            whereas the latter composes of thoughts and beliefs that an individual may possess.
            <br><br>
            While laws against racism exist, racism, both structural and individual, remains a problem in society more often than not.  
            More efforts are needed to implement these laws, educate people, and ensure equity.
